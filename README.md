## Installation

The code for the chat app can be found at the public [GitHub](). Either clone the repo to a local folder on your machine or
download and extract the archive if you don't have [Git] installed.

```sh
npm install
```	
## Run the app in development mode

After doing an `npm install` enter the following `node app.js` command:

```sh
node app.js
```
This will start the app and set it up to listen for incoming connections on port 3000. Open up your browser of choice and go to the url [http://localhost:3000/
(http://localhost:3000/) to start using the app itself.
